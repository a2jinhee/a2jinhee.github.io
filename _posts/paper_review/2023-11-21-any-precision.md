## 0. Abstract
- github code: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Any-Precision-DNNs
- Proposal: Any-precision deep neural networks which are trained with a new method that allows the learned DNNs to be flexible in numerical precision during **inference**
- How? By <ins>truncating</ins> the least significant bits. 
- Problem: Previous literature presents solutions to **train** models at fixed precision/accuracy trade-off point. $\rightarrow$ But how to produce a model flexible in **runtime precision** is largely unexplored

## 1. Introduction
- Previous literature
    1. Mixed-precision models: models with some layers processing in ultra-low precision and some layers in high precision 
- Main Problem
    - efficiency/accuracy trade-off always exists, so we have to find the right trade-off point, but what if we demand flexibility? 
    - That is, it would be favorable if we can *dynamically change* the efficiency/accuracy trad-off point given diffenert situations, without re-training or re-calibration 
- Contributions 
    - In runtime, we can quantize its layers into various precision layers without fine-tuning or calibration and without any data . Accuracy changes smoothly w.r.t. its precision level without drastic performance degradation 
    - Any-precision DNN trains better low-bit models with KD

### 3.1 Overview  

$$
y = w \cdot x + b
$$
- N-bit fixed-point integers to represent weights($w_Q$) and input activations($x_Q$)
$$
y' = s*(w_Q \cdot x_Q) + b
$$
- Adding a layer-wise scaling factor $s$ helps reduce the output range variation and hence achieve better model accuracy. 
- The activations $y'$ are then quantized into N-bit fixed-point integers

### 3.2 Inference
- **Once training is finished,** we can keep the weights at a higher precision level for storage e.g. 8 bits
- We quantize the weights into lower bit-width by bit-shifting (**truncate**)

### 3.3 Training 
- **Quantization-aware training (QAT)**  
    **"Train the model taking quantization into consideration"**
    - A full precision copy of the weights W is maintained throught the training. 
    - Small gradients are accumulated without loss of precision â†’ gradients effect the 'full precision copy of weights' 
    - Once the model is trained, only the quantized weights are used for inference. 
    - **BN layer is important in low-precision DNN** 
    - $y'$ is first passed into the BN layer and THEN quantized into $y_Q$
    
- **Weights.**  

    - **Uniform quantization strategy**: 
        - Normalize weights to [0,1]:  
        [graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1du8fwsskp)  
        <!-- $$
        w' = \frac{tanh(w)}{2\max(|tanh(w)|)}+0.5
        $$ --> 
        <div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20w'%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Btanh(w)%7D%7B2%5Cmax(%7Ctanh(w)%7C)%7D%2B0.5"></div>   
        - Quantize normalized value into N-bit integer   
        <!-- $$
        w_Q' = INT(round(w'* MAX_N)) \quad s' = 1/MAX_N
        $$ --> 
        <div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20w_Q'%20%3D%20INT(round(w'*%20MAX_N))%20%5Cquad%20s'%20%3D%201%2FMAX_N"></div> 
        where $MAX_N$ denotes the upper-bound of N-bit integer
        - Values remapped to approximate the range of floating point values to obtain
        <!-- $$
        w_Q = 2*w_Q'-1 \quad s = \mathbb{E}(|w|)/MAX_N
        $$ --> 
        <div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20w_Q%20%3D%202*w_Q'-1%20%5Cquad%20s%20%3D%20%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D(%7Cw%7C)%2FMAX_N"></div> 
        - Approximate $w$ with $s*w_Q$

    - Forward Pass
        - Execute feed-forward pass with quantized weights:
        <!-- $$
        y' = s*(w_Q \cdot x_Q) + b
        $$ --> 
        <div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20y'%20%3D%20s*(w_Q%20%5Ccdot%20x_Q)%20%2B%20b"></div>
        Overload of notation 's' - (1) quantization scaling factor for weights, (2) layer-wise scaling factor to reduce output range variation 

    - Backward Pass
        - Gradients are computed w.r.t the underlying float-value variable $w$(because we use the quantized version $w_Q$, in the feed-forward pass) and updates are applied to $w$ as well.
        - **Straight through estimator (STE)**: Used to approximate gradients   
            (ex) round op. has zero derivatives everywhere (why? because it's a step function). With STE, the gradient of round op. is 1. 

- **Activations.**
