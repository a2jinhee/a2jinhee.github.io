## 0. Abstract
- github code: [https://github.com/xuke225/EQ-Net](https://github.com/xuke225/EQ-Net)
- Proposal: EQ-Net which aims to train a robust weight-sharing quantization supernet 
    1. Elastic Quantization Space: Elastic bit-width, granularity, and symmetry → to adapt to various mainstream quantitative forms 
    2. Weight Distribution Regularization Loss (WDR-Loss) and Group Progressive Guidance Loss (GPG-Loss) → to bridge the inconsistency of the distribution for weights and ouput logits in the elastic quantization space gap 
    3. Conditional Quantization-Aware Accuracy Precision (CQAP) as an estimator to quickly search mixed-precision quantized NN in supernet. 

## 1. Introduction
- Quantization incurs added noise due to reduced precision 
    - PTQ: Only requires access to a small calibration dataset → effectiveness declines when applied to low bit quantization (<= 4bits)
    - QAT: By simulating the quantization operation during training or fine-tuning, the network can adapt to quantization noise → better than PTQ
- Problem: The forms of quantization supported by different hardware platforms are all different. (ex) NVIDIA's GPU (channel-wise symmetric quantization in TensorRT inference engine), Qualcomm's DSP (per-tensor asymmetric quantization in SNPE inference engine) → repeated optimization leads to low efficiency of model qunatization deployment
- Proposal
    1. Elastic Quantization Space: A unified quantization formula that integrates various model quantization forms and implementing elastic switching of 1) Quantization bit-width, 2) Quanization granularity 3) Quantization symmetry through parameter splitting
    2. WDR-Loss, GPG-Loss: Unlike NAS, EQ-Net is fully parameter-shared, and **there is no additional weight parameter optimization space with network structure differences.** → problem of **negative gradient suppression**(due to different quantization forms; samples with inconsistent predictions between quantization configurations) → WDR-Loss, GPG-Loss is an efficient training strategy for EQ-Net
    3. CQAP combined with a genetic algorithm: Specify any form in the elastic quantization space and quickly obtain a quantized model with the corresponding accuracy. (Can achieve both uniform and MPQ)

### 3.2 Elastic Quantization Space Design 
#### 3.2.1 Elastic Quantization Bit-Width
- Separate and store the quantization step size and zero-point required for different quantization bit-widths.
- Higher bit-widths: Small quantization step size → Large saturation truncation range 
- Lower bit-widths: Larger quantization step size → Small saturation truncation range
→ Alleviates training pressure for hyperparameters
→ Poses challenges to the robustness of shared weights.

#### 3.2.2 Elastic Quantization Symmetry
- Symmetric quantization: Zero-point is fixed to 0 (z = 0)
- Asymmetric quantization: Zero-point is adjustable to different ranges (z ∈ Z).
- The switching between the two is achieved by dynamically modifying the value of the zero point.

#### 3.2.1 Elastic Quantization Granularity
- Supports both **per-tensor**(one set of step size and zero-point for a tensor in one layer) and **per-channel**(quantizes each weight kernel independently) quantization.
- **per-tensor** > **per-channel**
- Step size and zero point for per-tensor can be obtained heuristically from per-channel, or can be learned as independent parameters
- EQG is for weights only, activation is are all in the form of per-tensor


### 3.3 Elastic Quantization Network Modeling
- Elastic quantization space of a model: $\varepsilon = \\{\varepsilon_{b}, \varepsilon_{g}, \varepsilon_{s}\\}$
- Training objective: Minimize the task loss under all elastic spaces elastic quantization spaces by optimizing the **weights, step sizes, and zero points**

### 3.4 Elastic Quantization Training
#### Weight Distribution Regularization
- DNN weights often conform to Gaussian or Laplace distributions
- Skewness regularization: Reducing skewness → enhance robustness of weights in elastic **symmetry**
- Kurtosis regularization: Reducing sharpness → enhance robustness of weights in elastic **bit-width**

\begin{align*}
\text{Skew}[w] &= E\bigl[(\frac{w-\mu}{\sigma})^3\bigr] \\
\text{Kurt}[w] &= E\bigl[(\frac{w-\mu}{\sigma})^4\bigr]

#### Group Progressive Guidance 
- There are multitude of subnets with varying quantization configurations, thereby enabling the generation of diverse soft labels.

- The impact of skewness and sharpness of weight distribution on fixed bit-width quantization is relatively insignificant. 
- However, for elastic quantization with high robustness demands, such phenomena can significantly affect the overall performance, **particularly for low bit widths.**
- Simultaneously applying kurtosis and skewness regularization can lead to a distribution effect that is closer to uniform distribution, eliminating data skewness and sharpness. 

#### Effectiveness of Group Progressive Guidance
- GPG utilizes soft labels from the high bit-width subnet to progressively guide the low bit-width subnet, creating more coherence between the output of the high and low bit-width networks.
- To demonstrate the training efficiency of the whole quantization supernet, we use the average precision of 2-4-8 bit-widths,and the average precision of our method is always the best.
- The Convergence Curve of ResNet20 trained using three different methods(hard label, label smoothing, and our GPG method).
